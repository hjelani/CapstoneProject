									<h1>NBA History<br /></h1>
									<h3>Early Years (1946-1956)</h3>
									<p>The National Basketball Association (NBA) was founded on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association of America (BAA). The league was created by Maurice Podoloff, who served as the first commissioner. The BAA merged with the National Basketball League (NBL) in 1949 to form the modern NBA. The original teams were the Boston Celtics, Chicago Stags, Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Falcons, Fort Wayne Pistons, Minneapolis Lakers, New York Knicks, Philadelphia Warriors, Philadelphia Pistons, Providence Steamrollers, St. Louis Bombers, and Syracuse Nationals.<br /><br /></p>

The Boston Celtics dominated the league during this period, winning an unprecedented 11 championships in a row from 1959 to 1969.
